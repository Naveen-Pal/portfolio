Dark web is place in internet mostly used for illegal purposes
## Hiddien wiki
If you don't what you should do after connect to tor. Just go to the hidden wiki. where you will find a lots of drak web url (.onion) to explore more. 

## Carding
People makes money by buying credit card information of someone else. Yeah it's prety bad but no one can do anything it prevent that.

## Chating
Whenever to talk someone on the dark web why they are there. I found most of the people are there for money or illegal purposes. So it's always better to not trust them.
