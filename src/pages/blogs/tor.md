### Dark web
The dark web is a hidden part of the internet that requires special software like Tor to access, where users can browse anonymously. It is often used for privacy-focused communication and illegal activities like black markets.

### Carding
People makes money by buying credit card information of someone else. These stolen details are obtained through data breaches, phishing, or malware and sold on dark web marketplaces.

### Chating
Whenever to talk someone on the dark web why they are there. I found most of the people are there for money or illegal purposes. So it's always better to not trust them.
