# NDA SSB Airforce in Gandhinagar

In 2022 and 2023, I qualified for the NDA written exams, a milestone that filled me with immense pride. My journey to the SSB (Service Selection Board) was shaped by a unique set of circumstances. Scheduled just three days after my JEE Mains in January, I faced a challenging decision. However, my intent was clear; I wasn’t aiming to become an Airforce officer just yet but was eager to immerse myself in the five-day SSB experience to understand and learn from it firsthand. I prioritized the Airforce, followed by the Navy and the Army, aligning with my interests and aspirations.

My SSB experience began with the thrill of reporting at the SSB board in Gandhinagar. After the essential document checks and filling out PIQ forms, we dived into the screening process. This included the OIR test featuring verbal and non-verbal questions and the PPDT, which involved story writing and group discussions. Post the tests, we enjoyed a simple lunch of sandwiches and tea, a perfect break before the results announcement. I vividly remember the anticipation in the air as I awaited them to call out chest number 2—my number. Hearing it confirmed during the screening results brought a surge of happiness. I was in, and the adventure was truly underway.

We were then allotted rooms—mine was Kiran—and shared with seven other candidates. This was when we explored the vast facilities, including the cafeteria, library, mess, gym, sports ground, games room, and an intriguing room filled with aircraft models. The nights were filled with light-hearted fun, including Antakshari, pillow fights (our pillows turned swords and blankets transformed into shields), and sneakily avoiding the gaze of cameras after lights out. These moments, stretching beyond the official 10 PM bedtime to about 11 PM, helped forge strong bonds among us.

The following days were a mix of nervous excitement and intense engagements. The interview day saw my heart racing, but the conversation with the interviewer was genuinely enriching. To unwind, we indulged in sports and hung out in the cafeteria, where we also had brief moments to connect with our families via phone.

A free day allowed me to soak in the tranquility of the library, preparing mentally for the next phase. The GTO tests then took center stage, challenging our physical and mental fortitude through various tasks like Group Discussions on current affairs, Group Planning Exercises, Progressive Group Tasks, and more. Each task was a learning curve, teaching us about teamwork, leadership, and strategy under pressure.

The culmination of these tests led to the final announcements. Although I wasn’t selected, a peer from my room—a Navodaya school alumnus with an impressive array of sports certificates—made the cut. Despite this, I left Gandhinagar not with disappointment but with a treasure trove of experiences and new friendships.

Returning home was not a solitary journey this time; it was accompanied by a profound sense of accomplishment and growth. The NDA SSB was more than just a selection process for me—it was a vibrant chapter of learning, fun, and personal evolution, a narrative I will cherish as I forge ahead in my endeavors.
