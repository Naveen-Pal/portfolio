Tico is a clone of git (a version control system), a command line tool. I made this project to assist the participants of a system programming project in Winter of Code (WOC) 2.0. I use Python language for this project. My fellow Karan was doing it in C++. I also made the tutorial video https://youtu.be/A4JXYHFW7FM for it.
