Hi, this my portfolio inspired by youtube.
<br>
In December 2024 another summer vacation, I got an idea for my portfolio and decided to change my <a href="https://naveenpal.netlify.app/">old portfolio</a> and switch to portfolio which is unique and much interective and user friendly. I found youtube interface suitable for my portfolio and inspire by this I made a portfolio in which anyone can easily nevigates to any of my project.
<br>
I used astro framework for building my portfolio.
