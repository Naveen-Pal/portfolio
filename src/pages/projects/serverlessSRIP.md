This project leverages serverless, event-driven architecture with Knative services to optimize SRIP portal performance. By enabling auto-scaling, dynamic resource allocation, and cost efficiency, it minimizes wastage and ensures seamless operation under varying workloads. The solution automates scaling, traffic routing, and resource management, providing a reliable, secure, and efficient platform tailored for dynamic, high-traffic event-driven applications.

<b>In simple words</b>, we are making SRIP portal capable to handel high traffic by effictively utilising the resources.

## Last year case Study 

Overwhelming Traffic: The portal experienced unprecedented traffic, causing a three-day outage.
Disrupted Internship Applications: Hundreds of interns were unable to complete their applications during this period.
Data Loss: Critical application data was lost, impacting the overall process.
Deadline Adjustments: Application deadlines had to be extended, affecting the schedule.
Reputational Impact: The downtime negatively affected the standing and reliability of IITGN's systems.
